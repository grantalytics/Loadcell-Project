Welcome! This is an arduino project utilizing a loadcell, a 7-Segment display, and an HX711 Load Cell Amplifier from Sparkfun. The final design consisted of 2 tactile buttons for turning the scale on and to tare the scale. It also had a 2-position slide switch which switched the display units from (lbs) to (kgs).

The following libraries which can be found on Github were used

To calibrate and manage the data coming from the loadcell.

To output the loadcell readings to a 40-pin 7-Segment display
